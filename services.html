            <p>
              Structured discovery to understand your programmes, fundraising,
              reporting and governance requirements. This includes mapping
              existing processes, clarifying user journeys and translating them
              into a Salesforce design that supports your strategy rather than
              forcing you to work around the system.

              Configuration of Salesforce (including Nonprofit Success Pack
              where appropriate) to match your data model and workflows: custom
              objects and fields, record types, page layouts, validation rules,
              security and sharing, profiles and permission sets – aligned with

              manual admin: automated tasks and reminders, email notifications,
              approvals, service pipelines, grant cycles and stewardship
              workflows that keep work moving without over‑complicating the
              build.

              service volumes, outcomes and funder‑specific metrics that matter
